# Access Control System - User Guide

## Overview

The Access Control System implements the core concept: **"Access is a thing, not a side effect"**. Every student's access to a course is explicitly tracked with full audit trails, source tracking, and expiration management.

---

## 🚀 Quick Access

### Django Admin Panel (Current Method)

**URL:** `/admin/` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/admin/`)

**Login:** Use your admin/staff credentials

**Available Features:**
- ✅ Bundles (Products)
- ✅ Cohorts (Groups)
- ✅ Course Access Management
- ✅ Bundle Purchases
- ✅ Learning Paths

---

## 📋 Available Features

### 1. **Bundles (Products)**

**Location:** Django Admin → Bundles

**What it does:**
- Create product bundles that grant access to multiple courses
- Perfect for Black Friday promos, course packages, etc.
- Supports 3 bundle types:
  - **Fixed Bundle**: Curated set of courses
  - **Pick Your Own**: Student chooses N courses
  - **Tiered**: Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers

**How to Use:**
1. Go to `/admin/myApp/bundle/`
2. Click "Add Bundle"
3. Fill in:
   - Name (e.g., "Black Friday 2025 Bundle")
   - Slug (auto-generated from name)
   - Bundle Type
   - Select courses to include
   - Price (optional)
4. Save

**Granting Bundle Access:**
- When someone purchases a bundle, create a `BundlePurchase` record
- The system automatically grants access to all courses in the bundle
- Access is tracked with full audit trail

---

### 2. **Cohorts (Groups)**

**Location:** Django Admin → Cohorts

**What it does:**
- Group students together (e.g., "Black Friday 2025 Buyers", "VIP Mastermind")
- Automatically grant course access to all members
- Perfect for managing large groups of students

**How to Use:**
1. Go to `/admin/myApp/cohort/`
2. Click "Add Cohort"
3. Fill in:
   - Name (e.g., "Black Friday 2025 Buyers")
   - Description
   - Is Active
4. Save

**Adding Members:**
1. Go to `/admin/myApp/cohortmember/`
2. Click "Add Cohort Member"
3. Select:
   - Cohort
   - User
   - Remove Access on Leave (if True, removing from cohort revokes access)

**Note:** Currently, cohorts don't have a direct course relationship. You'll need to manually grant course access via CourseAccess records when adding members, or extend the system to add a many-to-many relationship between Cohort and Course.

---

### 3. **Course Access Management**

**Location:** Django Admin → Course Accesses

**What it does:**
- Explicitly track every student's access to every course
- Shows source of access (Bundle, Manual, Cohort, Purchase, Subscription)

**Access Types:**
- **Purchase**: Direct course purchase
- **Manual**: Admin-granted (comps, VIPs, support fixes)
- **Cohort**: Granted via cohort membership
- **Subscription**: Subscription/membership access
- **Bundle**: Granted via bundle purchase

**How to Grant Access:**
1. Go to `/admin/myApp/courseaccess/`

   - Source (Bundle Purchase, Cohort, Purchase ID, or Granted By for manual)
   - Expires At (optional - for time-limited access)
   - Notes (for audit trail)
4. Save

**How to Revoke Access:**
1. Find the CourseAccess record
2. Edit it
3. Change Status to "Revoked"
4. Fill in:
   - Revoked By (select yourself)
   - Revocation Reason
   - Notes
5. Save

---

### 4. **Bundle Purchases**

**Location:** Django Admin → Bundle Purchases

---

### 5. **Learning Paths**

**Location:** Django Admin → Learning Paths

**What it does:**
- Create curated learning journeys (e.g., "7-Figure Launch Path")
- Define course order and prerequisites
- Students complete one course to unlock the next

**How to Use:**

   - Grant bundle access from member detail page
   - Quick actions in students list

   - Webhook integration for payment processors
   - Auto-revoke on refund/chargeback

---

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

1. **Always use CourseAccess records** - Don't rely on CourseEnrollment alone. CourseAccess is the source of truth.

2. **Use meaningful notes** - Add notes to every access grant/revoke for audit trail:
   - "Black Friday Bundle 2025 purchase"
   - "VIP comp - influencer partnership"
   - "Refund processed - customer requested"

3. **Set expiration dates** - For time-limited access, always set `expires_at`:
   - Trial access: 7-30 days
   - Promo access: Until specific date
   - Subscription access: Check subscription status regularly

4. **Use cohorts for groups** - Instead of manually adding 500 students to 12 courses, create a cohort and grant access once.

5. **Bundle everything** - For promos, always create bundles. Makes it easy to:
   - Grant access to all courses at once
   - Track who bought what
   - Revoke access if needed

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Why can't this student access the course?"
1. Go to `/admin/myApp/courseaccess/`
2. Filter by User and Course
3. Check:
   - Is there an access record?
   - Is status "unlocked"?
   - Has it expired? (check `expires_at`)
   - Was it revoked? (check status and `revoked_at`)

### "How did this student get access?"
1. Find their CourseAccess record
2. Check the `get_source_display()` or look at:
   - `bundle_purchase` (if from bundle)
   - `cohort` (if from cohort)
   - `granted_by` (if manual)
   - `purchase_id` (if direct purchase)

### "I need to grant access to 100 students"
**Option 1: Use Cohort**
1. Create cohort
2. Add all 100 students to cohort
3. Grant course access with cohort as source (you may need to do this programmatically or extend the system)

**Option 2: Use Bundle**
1. Create bundle with the courses
2. Create BundlePurchase for each student
3. Access is automatically granted

**Option 3: Django Shell (for bulk operations)**
```python
from myApp.utils.access import grant_course_access
from myApp.models import User, Course

users = User.objects.filter(email__endswith='@company.com')
course = Course.objects.get(slug='course-slug')

for user in users:
    grant_course_access(
        user=user,
        course=course,
        access_type='manual',
        notes="Bulk grant - company partnership"
    )
```

## 📞 Need Help?

If you need to:
- Grant bulk access to many students
- Integrate with payment processors
- Build custom UI for access management
- Add cohort-to-course relationships

These features can be built using the existing models and utility functions. The foundation is all there - you just need to build the UI/views on top of it!
